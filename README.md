##  Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
Predicting survival on the Titanic is a classic beginner project in data science. The goal is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, etc.

### Dataset
The dataset includes information on individual Titanic passengers:
- Features: Age, Gender, Ticket Class, Fare, Cabin, etc.
- Target: Survived (1) or Not Survived (0)

### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand relationships between features and survival using visualizations.

3. **Model Selection**: Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict survival.

4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

### Results
The final model achieves 76% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting Titanic survival.
